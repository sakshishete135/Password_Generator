# Password_Generator

It is a tool that generates passwords based on the given guidelines that you set to create an unpredictable strong password for your accounts. This Password Generator enables the user to generate the password of their choice like the number of words, small case alphabets, digits, etc. Also here I've added two levels of passwords. The first generated password will be little be easier but the second one will be quite hard. Here I've just used the random module of python, which will randomly generate the password for enhanced security.
